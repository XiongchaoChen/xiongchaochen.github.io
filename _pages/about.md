I am a 4<sup>th</sup> year Ph.D candidate at the School of Engineering and Applied Science, Yale University. I am supervised by Dr. [Chi Liu](https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/chi_liu/) at [Yale Positron emission tomography (PET) Center](https://medicine.yale.edu/pet/). Before joining Yale, I received my B.S. degree in Optoelectronic Engineering at Huazhong Univ. of Sci. and Tech. (HUST), supervised by Dr. [Peng Fei](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gZ-U8XEAAAAJ&hl=en). In summer 2022, I worked as an image analytics research intern at [Siemens Healthineers (Malvern, PA)](https://www.siemens-healthineers.com/en-us) on accelerated MRI reconstruction. 

My research topics are deep learning-enabled medical imaging and imaging analysis techniques for reconstruction, registration, correction of nuclear medicine, CT, and MRI. My resume is [here](https://xiongchaochen.github.io/cv/).

I am expexted to graduate in **May 2024** and currently seeking full-time job opportunities. Please don't hesitate to contact me at **xiongchao.chen [at] yale.edu** if you have any openings.
