I am a 4<sup>th</sup> year Ph.D candidate at the Yale University School of Engineering and Applied Science. I am fortunately supervised by Prof. [Chi Liu](https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/chi_liu/) at Yale PET Center. Before joining Yale, I received my Bachelar of Science (BS) degree in Opto-Electronic Engineering at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), fortunately supervised by Prof. [Peng Fei](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gZ-U8XEAAAAJ&hl=en) at Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics. In summer 2022, I was an image analytics research intern at [Siemens Healthineers](https://www.siemens-healthineers.com/en-us)  (Malvern, PA) focusing on acceralated MRI reconstruction. 

My research topics include but are not limited to deep learning-enabled medical imaging and imaging analysis techniques for reconstruction, registration, attenuation correction, and denoising of PET/SPECT, CT, and MRI.

I am actively looking for summer internship positions in summer 2023. Please feel free to contact me at [xiongchao.chen@yale.edu](xiongchao.chen@yale.edu) if you have opening positions. Please find my resume [here](https://xiongchaochen.github.io/cv/).
