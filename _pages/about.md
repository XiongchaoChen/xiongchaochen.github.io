I am a 4<sup>th</sup> year Ph.D candidate at the School of Engineering and Applied Science, Yale University. My resume is available [here](https://xiongchaochen.github.io/cv/). I am fortunately supervised by Prof. [Chi Liu](https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/chi_liu/) at [Yale Positron emission tomography (PET) Center](https://medicine.yale.edu/pet/). Before joining Yale, I received my Bachelar of Science (BS) degree in Opto-Electronic Engineering at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), fortunately supervised by Prof. [Peng Fei](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gZ-U8XEAAAAJ&hl=en) at Wuhan Photoelectricity National Research Center. In summer 2022, I worked as an image analytics research intern at [Siemens Healthineers (Malvern, PA)](https://www.siemens-healthineers.com/en-us) focusing on accelerated MRI reconstruction. 

My research topics include but are not limited to deep learning-enabled medical imaging and imaging analysis techniques for reconstruction, registration, attenuation correction, and denoising of PET/SPECT, CT, and MRI.

I am actively looking for **summer internship positions** in summer 2023. Please feel free to contact me at xiongchao.chen [at] yale.edu if you have opening positions.
