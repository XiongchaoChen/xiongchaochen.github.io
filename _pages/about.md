I am a 5<sup>th</sup> (final) year Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at Yale University. My resume is [HERE](https://xiongchaochen.github.io/cv/). My research topics are deep learning-enabled medical imaging and imaging analysis techniques for reconstruction, registration, and correction of PET/SPECT, CT, and MRI. 

I am supervised by Dr. [Chi Liu](https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/chi_liu/) at [Yale Positron emission tomography (PET) Center](https://medicine.yale.edu/pet/). In 2019, I received my B.S. degree in Optoelectronic Engineering at Huazhong Univ. of Sci. and Tech. (HUST), supervised by Dr. [Peng Fei](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gZ-U8XEAAAAJ&hl=en). In the summer of 2022, I worked as an image analytics research intern at Siemens Medical Solutions (Malvern, PA) on accelerated MRI reconstruction. In the summer of 2023, I am working as an imaging physics research intern at Siemens Healthineers (Knoxville, TN) on TOF PET reconstruction. 

I am expected to graduate in **Jan 2024** and currently seeking full-time job opportunities. Please contact me at **xiongchao.chen [at] yale.edu** or **cxiongchao9587 [at] gmail.com** if you have any openings :)
