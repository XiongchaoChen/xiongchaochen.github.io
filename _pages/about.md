I am a 4<sup>th</sup> year Ph.D candidate at the Yale University School of Engineering and Applied Science. I am honored to be supervised by Prof. [Chi Liu](https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/chi_liu/) at Yale PET Center. Before joining Yale, I received my Bachelar of Science (BS) degree in Opto-Electronic Engineering at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), supervised by Prof. [Peng Fei](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gZ-U8XEAAAAJ&hl=en) at Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics. 

My research topics include but are not limited to deep learning-enabled medical imaging and imaging analysis techniques for reconstruction, registration, attenuation correction, and denoising of PET/SPECT, CT, and MRI.
